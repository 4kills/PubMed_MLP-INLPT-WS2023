# Meetingnotes 26.10.2023

## Participants
* [X] Lukas
* [X] Benedikt
* [X] Theo
* [X] Dominik

## Topics
* Explore PubMed API using Python library
* Explore OpenSearch capabilities for finding relevant documents for a search query
and analysis of text data (topic recognition etc.). 
=> can integrate word embedding model to find semantic similarities
* Experiment with Google Colab and Github and integrating them into our dev process. 


# Meetingnotes 23.10.2023

## Participants
* [X] Lukas
* [X] Benedikt
* [X] Theo
* [X] Dominik

## Topics
* Discuss which data set to use -> PubMed dataset
* Plan recurring meetings for the next weeks
    * -> every Monday 16:00 to 17:45
* Discuss how to proceed with the project
* Decision to look into opensearch
* first talk about frontend decisions
* create Discord server for communication


## Open Tasks
* [ ] Explore PubMed dataset
* [ ] Look into how to scrape the data set (look into the API)
* [ ] Look into different options to store the data
* [ ] Look into opensearch
* [ ] Analyze data set
* [ ] Maybe already look into pre-trained models, which could be used for the project (Should we do this already? Maybe it will be more efficient later because it gets introduced in the lecture)
* [ ] Look into simple first frontend implementation

## Participants
* [X] Lukas
* [X] Benedikt
* [X] Theo
* [X] Dominik

## Topics
* Discuss and decide on openSearch for data storage, further work on including data into openSearch
* Look into further vector features of openSearch (that were not discussed in the tutorial)
* Show progress with streamlit, decision to try further stuff (frontend) with streamlit

## Open Tasks
See above


# Meetingnotes 15.11.2023
## Participants
* [X] Lukas
* [X] Benedikt
* [X] Theo
* [X] Dominik

## Topics
* Quick meeting planning prior to the meeting with our supervisor tomorrow
* Discuss current progress and next steps

## Closed Tasks
* [ ] writing a scraper and scraping the dataset
* [ ] frontend implementation with streamlit
* [ ] setup project structure and api (with FastAPI) for the backend (that later hosts the model)

## Open Tasks
* next steps will be filled after the meeting with our supervisor


# Meetingnotes 16.11.2023 - Meeting with Supervisor
## Participants
* [X] Lukas
* [X] Benedikt
* [X] Theo
* [X] Dominik
* [X] Ashish

## Topics
* Discuss current progress and next steps
* Look at MoSCoW and discuss which features are mandatory, optional, should have and could have
* --> Team needs to further specify the features and the scope of the project. Especially functional requirements regarding types of questions the system should be able to answer.
* Talk about OpenSearch and further steps of storing the data -> include a vector field for now and rather over-collect the metadata instead of not including it
* maybe research vector-databases -> embeddings will later be discussed in the lect. delay that part until we know more about it
* talk our current workflow pipeline ideas and first implementations that can the be later improved upon
