* [X] Theo
* [X] Dominik

## Topics
* Explore PubMed API using Python library
* Explore OpenSearch capabilities for finding relevant documents for a search query
and analysis of text data (topic recognition etc.). 
=> can integrate word embedding model to find semantic similarities
* Experiment with Google Colab and Github and integrating them into our dev process.

## Topics
* Discuss which data set to use -> PubMed dataset
* Plan recurring meetings for the next weeks
    * -> every Monday 16:00 to 17:45
* Discuss how to proceed with the project
* Decision to look into opensearch
* first talk about frontend decisions
* create Discord server for communication


## Open Tasks
* [ ] Explore PubMed dataset
* [ ] Look into how to scrape the data set (look into the API)
* [ ] Look into different options to store the data
* [ ] Look into opensearch
* [ ] Analyze data set
* [ ] Maybe already look into pre-trained models, which could be used for the project (Should we do this already? Maybe it will be more efficient later because it gets introduced in the lecture)
* [ ] Look into simple first frontend implementation
