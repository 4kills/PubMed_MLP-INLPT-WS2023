    "answer":" Based on the context provided, yes, AI systems utilizing deep neural networks and machine learning algorithms are widely used for solving critical problems in bioinformatics, biomedical informatics, and precision medicine. However, the lack of transparency and explainability in complex ML models can be a challenge in sensitive areas like healthcare, where explainability and accountability are required by law. Explainable AI (XAI) is being developed to address this issue, but most interpretable ML methods have evolved from domains other than bioinformatics, making their direct application challenging without customization and domain adaptation.",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications have found widespread applications in many fields of science, technology, and medicine. The use of enhanced computing power of machines in clinical medicine and diagnostics has been under exploration since the 1960s. More recently, with the advent of advances in computing, algorithms enabling machine learning, especially deep learning networks that mimic the human brain in function, there has been renewed interest to use them in clinical medicine. In cardiovascular medicine, AI-based systems have found new applications in cardiovascular imaging, cardiovascular risk prediction, and newer drug targets. This article aims to describe different AI applications including machine learning and deep learning and their applications in cardiovascular medicine. AI-based applications have enhanced our understanding of different phenotypes of heart failure and congenital heart disease. These applications have led to newer treatment strategies for different types of cardiovascular diseases, newer approach to cardiovascular drug therapy and postmarketing survey of prescription drugs. However, there are several challenges in the clinical use of AI-based applications and interpretation of the results including data privacy, poorly selected\/outdated data, selection bias, and unintentional continuance of historical biases\/stereotypes in the data which can lead to erroneous conclusions.

    "question":"What are the four categories of facial image manipulation techniques?",
    "answer":" The four categories of facial image manipulation techniques are entire face synthesis, identity swap, attribute manipulation, and expression swap.",
    "contexts":[
      "Recent advances in artificial intelligence technology have significantly improved facial image manipulation, which is known as Deepfake. Facial image manipulation synthesizes or replaces a region of the face in an image with that of another face. The techniques for facial image manipulation are classified into four categories: (1) entire face synthesis, (2) identity swap, (3) attribute manipulation, and (4) expression swap. Out of them, we focus on expression swap because it effectively manipulates only the expression of the face in the images or videos without creating or replacing the entire face, having advantages for the real-time application. In this study, we propose an evaluation framework of the expression swap models targeting the real-time online class environments. For this, we define three kinds of scenarios according to the portion of the face in the entire image considering actual online class situations: (1) attendance check (Scenario\u00a01), (2) presentation (Scenario\u00a02), and (3) examination (Scenario\u00a03). Considering the manipulation on the online class environments, the framework receives a single source image and a target video and generates the video that manipulates a face of the target video to that in the source image. To this end, we select two models that satisfy the conditions required by the framework: (1) first order model and (2) GANimation. We implement these models in the framework and evaluate their performance for the defined scenarios. Through the quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we observe distinguishing properties of the used two models. Specifically, both models show acceptable results in Scenario\u00a01, where the face occupies a large portion of the image. However, their performances are significantly degraded in Scenarios\u00a02 and 3, where the face occupies less portion of the image; the first order model causes relatively less loss of image quality than GANimation in the result of the quantitative evaluation. In contrast, GANimation has the advantages of representing facial expression changes compared to the first order model. Finally, we devise an architecture for applying the expression swap model to the online video conferencing application in real-time. In particular, by applying the expression swap model to widely used online meeting platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams, we demonstrate its feasibility for real-time online classes.",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most promising fields of research in medical imaging so far. By means of specific algorithms, it can be used to help radiologists in their routine workflow. There are several papers that describe AI approaches to solve different problems in liver and pancreatic imaging. These problems may be summarized in four different categories: segmentation, quantification, characterization and image quality improvement. Segmentation is usually the first step of successive elaborations. If done manually, it is a time-consuming process. Therefore, the semi-automatic and automatic creation of a liver or a pancreatic mask may save time for other evaluations, such as quantification of various parameters, from organs volume to their textural features. The alterations of normal liver and pancreas structure may give a clue to the presence of a diffuse or focal pathology. AI can be trained to recognize these alterations and propose a diagnosis, which may then be confirmed or not by radiologists. Finally, AI may be applied in medical image reconstruction in order to increase image quality, decrease dose administration (referring to computed tomography) and reduce scan times. In this article, we report the state of the art of AI applications in these four main categories.",
      "Advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of free, large databases have made it possible, even for non-technical people, to either manipulate or generate realistic facial samples for both benign and malicious purposes. DeepFakes refer to face multimedia content, which has been digitally altered or synthetically created using deep neural networks. The paper first outlines the readily available face editing apps and the vulnerability (or performance degradation) of face recognition systems under various face manipulations. Next, this survey presents an overview of the techniques and works that have been carried out in recent years for deepfake and face manipulations. Especially, four kinds of deepfake or face manipulations are reviewed, i.e., identity swap, face reenactment, attribute manipulation, and entire face synthesis. For each category, deepfake or face manipulation generation methods as well as those manipulation detection methods are detailed. Despite significant progress based on traditional and advanced computer vision, artificial intelligence, and physics, there is still a huge arms race surging up between attackers\/offenders\/adversaries (i.e., DeepFake generation methods) and defenders (i.e., DeepFake detection methods). Thus, open challenges and potential research directions are also discussed. This paper is expected to aid the readers in comprehending deepfake generation and detection mechanisms, together with open issues and future directions."

      "In the present epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), radiological imaging modalities, such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT), have been identified as effective diagnostic tools. However, the subjective assessment of radiographic examination is a time-consuming task and demands expert radiologists. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have enhanced the diagnostic power of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools and assisted medical specialists in making efficient diagnostic decisions. In this work, we propose an optimal multilevel deep-aggregated boosted network to recognize COVID-19 infection from heterogeneous radiographic data, including X-ray and CT images. Our method leverages multilevel deep-aggregated features and multistage training via a mutually beneficial approach to maximize the overall CAD performance. To improve the interpretation of CAD predictions, these multilevel deep features are visualized as additional outputs that can assist radiologists in validating the CAD results. A total of six publicly available datasets were fused to build a single large-scale heterogeneous radiographic collection that was used to analyze the performance of the proposed technique and other baseline methods. To preserve generality of our method, we selected different patient data for training, validation, and testing, and consequently, the data of same patient were not included in training, validation, and testing subsets. In addition, fivefold cross-validation was performed in all the experiments for a fair evaluation. Our method exhibits promising performance values of 95.38%, 95.57%, 92.53%, 98.14%, 93.16%, and 98.55% in terms of average accuracy, F-measure, specificity, sensitivity, precision, and area under the curve, respectively and outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.",
      "E-health has grown into a billion-dollar industry in the last decade. Its device's high throughput makes it an obvious target for cyberattacks, and these environments desperately need protection. In this scientific study, we presented an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven software-defined networking (SDN)-enabled intrusion detection system (IDS) to address increasing cyber threats in the E-health and internet of medical things (IoMT) environments. AI's success in various fields, including big data and intrusion detection systems, has prompted us to develop a flexible and cost-effective approach to protect such critical environments from cyberattacks. We present a hybrid model consisting of long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The proposed model was thoroughly evaluated using the publicly available CICDDoS2019 dataset and conventional evaluation measures. Furthermore, for proper validation, the proposed framework is compared with relevant classifiers, such as cu-GRU+ DNN and cu-BLSTM. We have further compared the proposed model with existing literature to prove its efficacy. Lastly, 10-fold cross-validation is also used to verify that our results are unbiased.

      "Treatment of lung diseases, which are the third most common cause of death in the world, is of great importance in the medical field. Many studies using lung sounds recorded with stethoscope have been conducted in the literature in order to diagnose the lung diseases with artificial intelligence-compatible devices and to assist the experts in their diagnosis. In this paper, ICBHI 2017 database which includes different sample frequencies, noise and background sounds was used for the classification of lung sounds. The lung sound signals were initially converted to spectrogram images by using time-frequency method. The short time Fourier transform (STFT) method was considered as time-frequency transformation. Two deep learning based approaches were used for lung sound classification. In the first approach, a pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) model was used for feature extraction and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used in classification of the lung sounds. In the second approach, the pre-trained deep CNN model was fine-tuned (transfer learning) via spectrogram images for lung sound classification. The accuracies of the proposed methods were tested by using the ten-fold cross validation. The accuracies for the first and second proposed methods were 65.5% and 63.09%, respectively. The obtained accuracies were then compared with some of the existing results and it was seen that obtained scores were better than the other results."

      "Industry 4.0 and digital transformation will likely come with an era of changes for most manufacturers and tech industries, and even healthcare delivery will likely be affected. A few trends are already foreseeable such as an increased number of patients, advanced technologies, different health-related business models, increased costs, revised ethics, and regulatory procedures. Moreover, cybersecurity, digital invoices, price transparency, improving patient experience, management of big data, and the need for a revised education are challenges in response to digital transformation. Indeed, forward-looking innovation about exponential technologies and their effect on healthcare is now gaining momentum. Thus, we developed a framework, followed by an online survey, to investigate key areas, analyze and visualize future-oriented developments concerning technologies and innovative business models while attempting to translate visions into a strategy toward healthcare democratization. When forecasting the future of health in a short and long-term perspective, results showed that digital healthcare, data management, electronics, and sensors were the most common predictions, followed by artificial intelligence in clinical diagnostic and in which hospitals and homes would be the places of primary care. Shifting from a reactive to a proactive digital ecosystem, the focus on prevention, quality, and faster care accessibility are the novel value propositions toward democratization and digitalization of patient-centered services. Longevity will translate into increased neurodegenerative, chronic diseases, and mental illnesses, becoming severe issues for a future healthcare setup. Besides, data privacy, big data management, and novel regulatory procedures were considered as potential problems resulting from digital transformation. However, a revised education is needed to address these issues while preparing future health professionals. The \"P4 of health\", a novel business model that is outcome-based oriented, awareness and acceptance of technologies to support public health, a different mindset that is proactive and future-oriented, and an interdisciplinary setting to merge clinical and technological advances would be key to a novel healthcare ecosystem. Lastly, based on the developed framework, we aim to conduct regular surveys to capture up-to-date technological trends, sustainable health-related business models, and interdependencies.

      "A driver's internal state is a critical factor influencing driving performance, especially in cases of surprise or shock in response to unexpected incidents while driving. This study was designed to investigate the brain activity of a senior driver in response to simulated unexpected vehicle motion, compared with a relaxed state and normal driving.\nTo accomplish this, we created a driving simulator paradigm wherein participants were involved in one of the following three scenarios: sitting down and relaxing, normal driving around the city with traffic signals and other vehicles, and the exiting of a parking area. In the scenario where the driver was to exit the parking area, the gear was switched automatically by the CarMaker software without the driver being notified, leading to an unexpected condition. The driver's internal states were classified by artificial intelligence, based on information obtained through four-channel near-infrared spectroscopy.\nSignificant differences were observed between the hemodynamic responses obtained in the three conditions. Ultimately, this method can be used to update advanced driver assistance systems, with a view to preventing future traffic accidents, by activating in-vehicle safety functions based on the driver's condition.\nA driver's internal states in a panic situation while driving can be detected using near-infrared spectroscopy and artificial intelligence.",
      "This study developed a fixation-related electroencephalography band power (FRBP) approach for situation awareness (SA) assessment in automated driving.\nMaintaining good SA in Level 3 automated vehicles is crucial to drivers' takeover performance when the automated system fails. A multimodal fusion approach that enables the analysis of the visual behavioral and cognitive processes of SA can facilitate real-time assessment of SA in future driver state monitoring systems.\nThirty participants performed three simulated automated driving tasks. After each task, the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) was deployed to capture their SA about key elements that could affect their takeover task performance. Participants eye movements and brain activities were recorded. Data on their brain activity after each eye fixation on the key elements were extracted and labeled according to the correctness of the SAGAT. Mixed-effects models were used to identify brain regions that were indicative of SA, and machine learning models for SA assessment were developed based on the identified brain regions.\nParticipants' alpha and theta oscillation at frontal and temporal areas are indicative of SA. In addition, the FRBP technique can be used to predict drivers' SA with an accuracy of 88% using a neural network model.\nThe FRBP technique, which incorporates eye movements and brain activities, can provide more comprehensive evaluation of SA. Findings highlight the potential of utilizing FRBP to monitor drivers' SA in real-time.\nThe proposed framework can be expanded and applied to driver state monitoring systems to measure human SA in real-world driving.",
      "The purpose of this research was to develop a simple, cost-effective, but enough efficient solution for locating, tracking and distribution analysis of people and\/or vehicle flowing, based on non-intrusive Bluetooth sensing and selective filtering algorithms employing artificial intelligence components. The solution provides a tool for analyzing density of targets in a specific area, useful when checking contact proximities of a target along a route. The principle consists of the detection of mobile devices that use active Bluetooth connections, such as personal notebooks, smartphones, smartwatches, Bluetooth headphones, etc. to locate and track their movement in the dedicated area. For this purpose, a specific configuration of three BT sensors is used and RSSI levels compared, based on a combination of differential location estimates. The solution may also be suited for indoor localization where GPS signals are usually weak or missing; for example, in public places such as subway stations or trains, hospitals, airport terminals and so on. The applicability of this solution is estimated to be vast, ranging from travel and transport information services, route guidance, passenger flows tracking, and path recovery for persons suspected to have SARS-COV2 or other contagious viruses, serving epidemiologic enquiries. The specific configuration of Bluetooth detectors may be installed either in a fixed location, or in a public transport vehicle. A set of filters and algorithms for triangulation-based location of detected targets and movement tracking, based on artificial intelligence is employed. When applied in the public transport field, this setup can be also developed to extract additional information on traffic, such as private traffic flowing, or passenger movement patterns along the vehicle route, improved location in absence of GPS signals, etc. Field tests have been carried out for determining different aspects concerning indoor location accuracy, reliability, selection of targets and filtering. Results and possible applications are also presented in the final section of the paper."
