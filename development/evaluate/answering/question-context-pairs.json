        "abstract_fragment": "artificial intelligence ( ai ) systems utilizing deep neural networks and machine learning ( ml ) algorithms are widely used for solving critical problems in bioinformatics, biomedical informatics and precision medicine. however, complex ml models that are often perceived as opaque and black - box methods make it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their decisions. this lack of transparency can be a challenge for both end - users and decision - makers, as well as ai developers. in sensitive areas such as healthcare, explainability and accountability are not only desirable properties but also legally required for ai systems that can have a significant impact on human lives. fairness is another growing concern, as algorithmic decisions should not show bias or discrimination towards certain groups or individuals based on sensitive attributes. explainable ai ( xai ) aims to overcome the opaqueness of black - box models and to provide transparency in how ai systems make decisions. interpretable ml models can explain how they make predictions and identify factors that influence their outcomes. however, the majority of the state - of - the - art interpretable ml methods are domain - agnostic and have evolved from fields such as computer vision, automated reasoning or statistics, making direct application to bioinformatics problems challenging without customization and domain adaptation. in this paper, we discuss the importance of explainability and algorithm",
