1. Data Collection:
    1. Download the PubMed dataset. PubMed provides bulk data in XML format which can be parsed to extract abstracts.
    2. Download relevant metadata.
1. Data Pre-processing:
    1. Parse the XML files to extract text content from relevant fields such as titles, abstracts, metadata.
    1. Tokenize and clean the text. This involves removing special characters, converting all text to lowercase, and stemming or lemmatizing the words.
1. Selecting the Model Architecture:
    1. Start with a pre-trained LLM like GPT-4, LLAMA. 
1. Data Augmentation (Optional but beneficial):
    1. Use techniques like back-translation to create more diverse training examples.
1. Fine-tuning the Model:
    1. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
    1. Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the training dataset. Monitor the performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
1. Document Retrieval:
    1. Training:
        1. (Optional) Once you've collected and processed the PubMed dataset, index each document with a unique identifier. This could be the PubMed ID, DOI, or any other unique key associated with the paper.
            1. Use information retrieval tools, such as OpenSearch, to index the entire corpus. OpenSearch creates an inverted index of the dataset, enabling rapid, full-text searches.
            1. Alternatively Document Embeddings: Use dense vector embeddings for each document (e.g., using Sentence-BERT). When a question comes in, compute its embedding and find the most similar document embeddings. This can sometimes provide more accurate document retrieval than traditional keyword-based methods. This can be integrated with OpenSearch as well.
        1. (Optional) When training your model, also provide it with the unique identifier of the source document as part of the input. This way, the model learns to associate the content with its source.
    1. Inference:
        1. Document Retrieval Stage: When a question is asked, first use the information retrieval system (e.g., OpenSearch) to identify a subset of documents from the corpus that are likely to contain the answer. This step narrows down the potential sources of the answer.
        1. Reading & Answer Generation Stage: Feed the selected documents to the Transformer-based LLM to generate a precise answer.
        1. (Optional) Reference Retrieval Stage: Once the answer is generated, extract the unique identifier or reference from the model's output to identify which document the answer was sourced from.
1. Building the Question-Answering Interface:
    1. Design a user-friendly interface where users can input their questions.
    1. Implement the backend so that the model processes the question and searches the PubMed corpus to generate a relevant answer.
    1. Display the answer along with the reference or link to the specific document in PubMed. If using the PubMed ID or DOI, you can easily create a hyperlink that redirects users to the actual paper.
    1. (Optional) Consider adding a feedback loop, allowing users to rate the quality of answers to continuously improve the model.
1. Model Evaluation:
    1. Use the test set to evaluate the model's performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, or any other relevant metric.
    1. Consider using human evaluators to assess the quality and relevance of the answers.
