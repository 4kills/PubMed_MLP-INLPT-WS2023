I faced the following challenges:
- Discussions: In the team, there was often a lot of discussion which sometimes stopped us from being productive. 
- Docker: It is supposed to make things easier but is pain to use on different Operating Systems, especially trying to enable Hardware Acceleration.
- Teamwork on medium sized project. Our project is too large for 1 person but too small for 4 persons. We had to often work around merge conflicts and implementation issues. 
- Prompt engineering: Hard to make LLM follow instructions. 
- Python: For larger projects as this, statically typed languages would be much better to work with. Especially in a team. 
- Bleeding Edge Libraries: The AI eco system is rapidly evolving and the libraries are still full of bugs.
- Big data: Hard to work with. Trial-and-error scheme is not applicable.
